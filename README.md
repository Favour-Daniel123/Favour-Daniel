# TODAY's PROJECT: Mental Health Condition from 1990-2019 across the Globe.

Understanding the Global Landscape of Mental Health: Mental health is an essential part of people’s lives and society. Mental health affects everyone, everywhere. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.

# What is the SITUATION?
The mental health conditions which is also referred to as mental disorder are not uncommon. Hundreds of millions suffer from them yearly, and many more do over their lifetimes. This global issue demands our attention and action.

From this above bar chart, showing the number of countries with primary data on the prevalence of various mental disorders. 
## Here are the key observations:
•	Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has the highest data coverage, with 172 countries reporting prevalence data.

•	Cannabis use disorders (121 countries) and major depressive disorder (111 countries) also have significant global data availability.

•	Alcohol use disorders, amphetamine use disorders, and anxiety disorders each have data from 58 countries, indicating moderate coverage.

•	Cocaine use disorders (68 countries) and dysthymia (37 countries) have relatively lower coverage.

•	Autism spectrum disorders (34 countries), bipolar disorder (41 countries), bulimia nervosa (31 countries), and opioid use disorders (31 countries) have even less data available.

•	Anorexia nervosa (27 countries), other drug use disorders (2 countries), and personality disorders (2 countries) have the least reported prevalence data, highlighting potential gaps in global research.

This suggests that while some mental disorders, like ADHD and major depressive disorder, have broad data availability, others, particularly personality disorders and certain substance use disorders, have very limited data coverage across countries.

# How do we approach this problem? What's the Task/Methods Involved?
This project demands a significant level of structured data wrangling; for the data to be useful or provide any factual information. The data for this project will be collected from formal diagnoses at the Health Clinics, however, aside from the formal diagnoses, the data will also be collected using surveys and screening questionnaires. These tend to ask people about symptoms similar to those in diagnostic manuals, but they can be used more easily and widely because the data does not need to be collected by a healthcare professional.

## Overview of the Dataset

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26f6469a-f522-4ffc-87b6-170e849ed6ac)

The dataset contains global prevalence rates for several mental health disorders from 1990-2019, including:
• Schizophrenia disorders

• Depressive disorders

• Anxiety disorders

• Bipolar disorders

• Eating disorders

The data is broken down by country/region and year, with age-standardized prevalence rates.

# What are the strengths and limitations of this dataset?

### Strengths of this mental health survey dataset.
First, it involves structured interviews – people are asked a consistent set of questions regardless of their interviewer. This helps to ensure the data is more comparable between interviewers and across time. Secondly, this dataset include a much wider range of people in the population, including those who would not seek treatment due to a lack of awareness, costs, or other concerns.

## Limitations of this mental health survey dataset.
There are also several limitations of survey data to keep in mind. One is that people may not share their symptoms in surveys, as they may not feel comfortable sharing them with researchers. Along with this, people’s comfort in sharing mental health symptoms may vary between countries and over time. Another limitation is that people may not remember their symptoms, especially when they are asked to recall symptoms in their lifetime so far. This can be challenging for older people whose symptoms may have occurred decades ago.

# My Actions in solving this project

The first task was compiling all the dataset involved. These dataset, as seen in the below picture, are unstructured data that would need to be processed to give it structure. The next step, as seen in the picture below, was to append all the downloaded Excel files into a Master Excel Sheet and the benefit of this, is to make the mental health data analysis faster, more consistent, and more insightful.
