# PROJECT: Mental Health Condition from 1990-2019 across the Globe

Understanding the Global Landscape of Mental Health: Mental health is an essential part of people’s lives and society. Mental health affects everyone, everywhere. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.

# What is the SITUATION?
The mental health conditions which is also referred to as mental disorder are not uncommon. Hundreds of millions suffer from them yearly, and many more do over their lifetimes. This global issue demands our attention and action.

From this above bar chart, showing the number of countries with primary data on the prevalence of various mental disorders. Here are the key observations:
•	Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has the highest data coverage, with 172 countries reporting prevalence data.
•	Cannabis use disorders (121 countries) and major depressive disorder (111 countries) also have significant global data availability.
•	Alcohol use disorders, amphetamine use disorders, and anxiety disorders each have data from 58 countries, indicating moderate coverage.
•	Cocaine use disorders (68 countries) and dysthymia (37 countries) have relatively lower coverage.
•	Autism spectrum disorders (34 countries), bipolar disorder (41 countries), bulimia nervosa (31 countries), and opioid use disorders (31 countries) have even less data available.
•	Anorexia nervosa (27 countries), other drug use disorders (2 countries), and personality disorders (2 countries) have the least reported prevalence data, highlighting potential gaps in global research.
This suggests that while some mental disorders, like ADHD and major depressive disorder, have broad data availability, others, particularly personality disorders and certain substance use disorders, have very limited data coverage across countries.
